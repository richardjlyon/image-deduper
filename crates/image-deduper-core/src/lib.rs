//! Core functionality for finding and managing duplicate images.
//!
//! This library provides the foundational components for image deduplication.

// We'll start with just a simple placeholder
// You'll expand this according to the structure we discussed

/// A placeholder function to ensure the crate builds
pub fn hello() -> &'static str {
    "Hello from image-deduper-core!"
}

// These modules will be created later
// Uncomment them as you implement each one

// pub mod discovery;
// pub mod processing;
// pub mod deduplication;
// pub mod action;
